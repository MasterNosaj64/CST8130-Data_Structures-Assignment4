#Data Structures - Assignment 4 - CST8130 - Algonquin College - Computer Engineering - Computing Science

-  Rewrite a Router/Routing program to use hashing for inserts with a hash algorithm and collision resolution.
-  Implement a routing table using either a dynamically allocated array or an ArrayList of 100 RoutingTableEntry objects.
-  Use a hash algorithm based on the destination address for indexing, handling collisions by moving to the next available position.
-  Enhance search efficiency within the routing table and provide feedback on search outcomes.
-  Maintain packet processing as in previous assignments.
-  Optional: Implement a LinkedList at each array/ArrayList position to manage RoutingTableEntry objects and modify search to navigate the appropriate LinkedList.
